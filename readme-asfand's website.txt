approaching the client: 

client was of few demands. we had a call and went through the results from becki's questionnaire.

client chose a few pieces of information and sent over answers. mindset was to keep it brief and quite casual with some dismissive homour. this matches his personality. laid back until it's work time. 

this was a very informal chat and next time i will strive to be more prepared for the conversation.

ultimately, i was thankful that i had a lot of creative freedom. especially for my first website. i was only asked to stick to a greyscale colour scheme. 

i had to throw out the vague ideas i had for a strong contrast (eg. black and orange) and use of leaves in the corner. i knew i could use subtly colour changes to stop the site from looking completely flat (charcoals and off-white).

research:

i had just recently watched a video regarding css grids which, at the time thought, would easily replace the html structure tags (header, footer). when re-creating the google search page, the biggest struggle was placing a footer (carbon neutral and united kingdom) on top of the typical footer. while i just added padding, it was difficult to control and felt devoid of logic. imagine working to a responsive site. css grid would easily accomodate. 

i found a site layout that popped out to me on: https://medium.com/@dashbouquet/web-development-trends-that-will-dominate-in-2019-9dd94be8abb9
this was the type of site i wish i could create. this was a low quality image with no actual website attached to it. perfect as there was no way to cheat and copy over code i did not understand. i knew there were elements impossible to recreate and potentially some photoshop magic at this stage but i just needed the basic layout. 

plans:

sketched out the image and creating a css grid. this turned out to be 6 by 4. i wanted this to be responsive on the desktop atleast so divided page and coded vw and vh.

wanted a one page site that was clean and simple. 

a single image

reflection:

title-font could not be changed. setting font-family to * caused clashes when implemented elsewhere. this should have been applied to only the text section.

i should have used the normal structures and placed grids inside them. the site looks flat but potentially if i had placed a texture on the footer, this would be less hassle than adding and matching up a pattern for booth footer1 and footer2.

this is definitly not a responsive website. some elements are able to adjust but this needs more work to make sure i am not just working with pixels.

not mobile ready but happy with how this displayed on my pc. this is bad design. assuming everyone is using the same sized display. a sin i must atone for by created version 2. 

box-shadows why do you hurt me so? understood the basics but could not get a soft shadow to work on the right side of the page. 20px 0px appeared on the top not on the right. could be a diffusion issue.

did not have links to social media yet. should have asked for this earlier.
